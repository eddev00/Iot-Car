# Iot-Car
### Please refer to the report in files for detailed informations
This project involves designing and implementing an IoT-based remote-controlled (RC) car
using ESP32 microcontrollers, WiFi connectivity, and an Xbox 360 controller. The system
leverages MQTT for communication, integrates sensor-based environmental adaptations for
speed control, and includes a camera module for real-time video streaming. This only reflects
the current advancement on the project so far, and the full vision is detailed and highlighted
in the ”Future development and plans” section.
